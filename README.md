# 🌀 Palindrome Number Checker

This is a simple Java console application that checks if a given integer is a **palindrome** — a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## 📋 Description

The program:
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Reverses the number using arithmetic operations.
- Compares the reversed number with the original input.
- Prints whether the number is a palindrome.

### ✅ What is a Palindrome?

A **palindrome number** is a number that stays the same when its digits are reversed.

Examples:
- `121` → Palindrome ✅  
- `1331` → Palindrome ✅  
- `123` → Not a palindrome ❌
